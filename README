# Potential errors

`Cannot identify '/dev/video0': 2, No such file or directory`

Most likely cause is that the webcam got unplugged. Do the following:

 * Remove the container: `make rm-container`
 * Unplug the webcam; wait a few seconds; plug it back in
 * Verify that `/dev/video0` exists; if not, redo previous step
 * Start container: `make start-container`
 * Start demo: `make run-gpu`
